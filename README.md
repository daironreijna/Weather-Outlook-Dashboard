## Introduction

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. In this challenge, you will build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The dashboard will allow users to see the weather forecast for multiple cities, helping them plan their trips accordingly.

## User Story

As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

- When a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with:
  - The city name
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
  - The wind speed
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

### Motivation and Learning

This project is an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during week 8 of the course. It serves as a practical exercise to understand how to work with server APIs, retrieve and display data, and create a user-friendly web application. Additionally, this project encourages learning about data persistence using LocalStorage.

## Project Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I have been able to:
- Understand and utilize the concept and utility of APIs and JSON in web applications.
- Build endpoint URLs to a variety of APIs.
- Retrieve and process data from external APIs.
- Display current and future weather conditions for selected cities.
- Store and manage data using LocalStorage for a seamless user experience.

## User Story

As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.
