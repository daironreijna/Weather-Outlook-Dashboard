Welcome to the Weather Outlook Dashboard! In this project, I have created a web application that allows users to view the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. I have made use of the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Introduction

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This project builds a weather outlook dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The dashboard will allow users to see the weather forecast for multiple cities, helping them plan their trips accordingly.

## Technical Details

- The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.
- LocalStorage is used to store persistent data.

## Deployment

The Weather Dashboard Challenge is deployed at the following live URL:

[Weather Outlook Dashboard Live Demo](weather-outlook-dashboard.vercel.app)

The GitHub repository for this project can be found at:

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daironreijna/Weather-Outlook-Dashboard)

<br>
<u>In order to use this webapp, you will need to </u>

1. Create your own API key by visiting https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Create a config.js file in the asset/js folder
3. Save the API key in the below format

<b>Example:</b> 

````javascript
var config = {
	key: [YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_GOES_HERE],
};
````
````javascript
// ===== after placing your API key ===========
var config = {
	key: "14c5e5e260e3e3432d141deb7d150ec3",
};
````
## Motivation and Learning
This project is an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during week 8 of the course. It serves as a practical exercise to understand how to work with server APIs, retrieve and display data, and create a user-friendly web application. Additionally, this project encourages learning about data persistence using LocalStorage.

## Project Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I have been able to:

- Understand and utilize the concept and utility of APIs and JSON in web applications.
- Build endpoint URLs to a variety of APIs.
- Work with the OpenWeatherMap 5 Day Forecast API to retrieve weather data.
- Retrieve and process data from external APIs.
- Display current and future weather conditions for selected cities.
- Store and manage data using LocalStorage for a seamless user experience.
- Enhance my skills in front-end web development, including dynamic element generation and fetch calls.
- Create a real-world application that requires understanding different coding languages, concepts and functions.
